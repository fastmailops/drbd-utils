drbd.conf \- Configuration file for DRBD\*(Aqs devices
.SH "INTRODUCTION"
.PP
The file
\fB/etc/drbd\&.conf\fR
is read by
\fBdrbdadm\fR\&.
.PP
The file format was designed as to allow to have a verbatim copy of the file on both nodes of the cluster\&. It is highly recommended to do so in order to keep your configuration manageable\&. The file
\fB/etc/drbd\&.conf\fR
should be the same on both nodes of the cluster\&. Changes to
\fB/etc/drbd\&.conf\fR
do not apply immediately\&.
.PP
By convention the main config contains two include statements\&. The first one includes the file
\fB/etc/drbd\&.d/global_common\&.conf\fR, the second one all file with a
\fB\&.res\fR
suffix\&.

In this example, there is a single DRBD resource (called r0) which uses protocol C for the connection between its devices\&. It contains a single volume which runs on host
\fIalice\fR
uses
\fI/dev/drbd1\fR
as devices for its application, and
\fI/dev/sda7\fR
as low\-level storage for the data\&. The IP addresses are used to specify the networking interfaces to be used\&. An eventually running resync process should use about 10MByte/second of IO bandwidth\&. This resync\-rate statement is valid for volume 0, but would also be valid for further volumes\&. In this example it assigns full 10MByte/second to each volume\&.
.PP
There may be multiple resource sections in a single drbd\&.conf file\&. For more examples, please have a look at the
\m[blue]\fBDRBD User\*(Aqs Guide\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file consists of sections and parameters\&. A section begins with a keyword, sometimes an additional name, and an opening brace (\(lq{\(rq)\&. A section ends with a closing brace (\(lq}\(rq\&. The braces enclose the parameters\&.
.PP
section [name] { parameter value; [\&.\&.\&.] }
.PP
A parameter starts with the identifier of the parameter followed by whitespace\&. Every subsequent character is considered as part of the parameter\*(Aqs value\&. A special case are Boolean parameters which consist only of the identifier\&. Parameters are terminated by a semicolon (\(lq;\(rq)\&.
.PP
Some parameter values have default units which might be overruled by K, M or G\&. These units are defined in the usual way (K = 2^10 = 1024, M = 1024 K, G = 1024 M)\&.
.PP
Comments may be placed into the configuration file and must begin with a hash sign (\(lq#\(rq)\&. Subsequent characters are ignored until the end of the line\&.
.SS "Sections"
.PP
\fBskip\fR
.RS 4

Comments out chunks of text, even spanning more than one line\&. Characters between the keyword
\fBskip\fR
and the opening brace (\(lq{\(rq) are ignored\&. Everything enclosed by the braces is skipped\&. This comes in handy, if you just want to comment out some \*(Aq\fBresource [name] {\&.\&.\&.}\fR\*(Aq section: just precede it with \*(Aq\fBskip\fR\*(Aq\&.

Internal means that the last part of the backing device is used to store the meta\-data\&. The size of the meta\-data is computed based on the size of the device\&.
.sp
When a
\fIdevice\fR
is specified, either with or without an
\fIindex\fR, DRBD stores the meta\-data on this device\&. Without
\fIindex\fR, the size of the meta\-data is determined by the size of the data device\&. This is usually used with LVM, which allows to have many variable sized block devices\&. The meta\-data size is 36kB + Backing\-Storage\-size / 32k, rounded up to the next 4kb boundary\&. (Rule of the thumb: 32kByte per 1GByte of storage, rounded up to the next MB\&.)
.sp
When an
\fIindex\fR
is specified, each index number refers to a fixed slot of meta\-data of 128 MB, which allows a maximum data size of 4 TiB\&. This way, multiple DBRD devices can share the same meta\-data device\&. For example, if /dev/sde6[0] and /dev/sde6[1] are used, /dev/sde6 must be at least 256 MB big\&. Because of the hard size limit, use of meta\-disk indexes is discouraged\&.

\fBdiscard\-zeroes\-if\-aligned \fR\fB{yes | no}\fR
.RS 4

There are several aspects to discard/trim/unmap support on linux block devices\&. Even if discard is supported in general, it may fail silently, or may partially ignore discard requests\&. Devices also announce whether reading from unmapped blocks returns defined data (usually zeroes), or undefined data (possibly old data, possibly garbage)\&.
.sp
If on different nodes, DRBD is backed by devices with differing discard characteristics, discards may lead to data divergence (old data or garbage left over on one backend, zeroes due to unmapped areas on the other backend)\&. Online verify would now potentially report tons of spurious differences\&. While probably harmless for most use cases (fstrim on a file system), DRBD cannot have that\&.
.sp
To play safe, we have to disable discard support, if our local backend (on a Primary) does not support "discard_zeroes_data=true"\&. We also have to translate discards to explicit zero\-out on the receiving side, unless the receiving side (Secondary) supports "discard_zeroes_data=true", thereby allocating areas what were supposed to be unmapped\&.
.sp
There are some devices (notably the LVM/DM thin provisioning) that are capable of discard, but announce discard_zeroes_data=false\&. In the case of DM\-thin, discards aligned to the chunk size will be unmapped, and reading from unmapped sectors will return zeroes\&. However, unaligned partial head or tail areas of discard requests will be silently ignored\&.
.sp
If we now add a helper to explicitly zero\-out these unaligned partial areas, while passing on the discard of the aligned full chunks, we effectively achieve discard_zeroes_data=true on such devices\&.
.sp
Setting
\fBdiscard\-zeroes\-if\-aligned\fR

\fBc\-min\-rate \fR\fB\fImin_rate\fR\fR
.RS 4
A node that is primary and sync\-source has to schedule application IO requests and resync IO requests\&. The
\fImin_rate\fR
tells DRBD use only up to min_rate for resync IO and to dedicate all other available IO bandwidth to application requests\&.
.sp
Note: The value 0 has a special meaning\&. It disables the limitation of resync IO completely, which might slow down application IO considerably\&. Set it to a value of 1, if you prefer that resync IO never slows down application IO\&.
.sp
Note: Although the name might suggest that it is a lower bound for the dynamic resync speed controller, it is not\&. If the DRBD\-proxy buffer is full, the dynamic resync speed controller is free to lower the resync speed down to 0, completely independent of the
\fBc\-min\-rate\fR
setting\&.

This setting controls what happens to IO requests on a degraded, disk less node (I\&.e\&. no data store is reachable)\&. The available policies are

If
\fIond\-policy\fR

\fBsuspend\-io\fR
you can either resume IO by attaching/connecting the last lost data storage, or by the
\fBdrbdadm resume\-io \fR\fB\fIres\fR\fR

.SH "NOTES ON DATA INTEGRITY"
.PP
There are two independent methods in DRBD to ensure the integrity of the mirrored data\&. The online\-verify mechanism and the
\fBdata\-integrity\-alg\fR
of the
\fBnetwork\fR
section\&.
.PP
Both mechanisms might deliver false positives if the user of DRBD modifies the data which gets written to disk while the transfer goes on\&. This may happen for swap, or for certain append while global sync, or truncate/rewrite workloads, and not necessarily poses a problem for the integrity of the data\&. Usually when the initiator of the data transfer does this, it already knows that that data block will not be part of an on disk data structure, or will be resubmitted with correct data soon enough\&.
.PP
The
\fBdata\-integrity\-alg\fR
causes the receiving side to log an error about "Digest integrity check FAILED: Ns +x\en", where N is the sector offset, and x is the size of the request in bytes\&. It will then disconnect, and reconnect, thus causing a quick resync\&. If the sending side at the same time detected a modification, it warns about "Digest mismatch, buffer modified by upper layers during write: Ns +x\en", which shows that this was a false positive\&. The sending side may detect these buffer modifications immediately after the unmodified data has been copied to the tcp buffers, in which case the receiving side won\*(Aqt notice it\&.
.PP
The most recent (2007) example of systematic corruption was an issue with the TCP offloading engine and the driver of a certain type of GBit NIC\&. The actual corruption happened on the DMA transfer from core memory to the card\&. Since the TCP checksum gets calculated on the card, this type of corruption stays undetected as long as you do not use either the online
\fBverify\fR
or the
\fBdata\-integrity\-alg\fR\&.
.PP
We suggest to use the
\fBdata\-integrity\-alg\fR
only during a pre\-production phase due to its CPU costs\&. Further we suggest to do online
\fBverify\fR
runs regularly e\&.g\&. once a month during a low load period\&.
