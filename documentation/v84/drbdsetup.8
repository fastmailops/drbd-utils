.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
drbdsetup is used to associate DRBD devices with their backing block devices, to set up DRBD device pairs to mirror their backing block devices, and to inspect the configuration of running DRBD devices\&.
.SH "NOTE"
.PP
drbdsetup is a low level tool of the DRBD program suite\&. It is used by the data disk and drbd scripts to communicate with the device driver\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
Each drbdsetup sub\-command might require arguments and bring its own set of options\&. All values have default units which might be overruled by K, M or G\&. These units are defined in the usual way (e\&.g\&. K = 2^10 = 1024)\&.
.SS "Common options"
.PP
All drbdsetup sub\-commands accept these two options
.PP
\fB\-\-create\-device\fR
.RS 4
In case the specified DRBD device (minor number) does not exist yet, create it implicitly\&.
.RE
.SS "new\-resource"
.PP
Resources are the primary objects of any DRBD configuration\&. A resource must be created with the
\fBnew\-resource\fR
command before any volumes or minor devices can be created\&. Connections are referenced by name\&.
.SS "new\-minor"
.PP
A
\fIminor\fR
is used as a synonym for replicated block device\&. It is represented in the /dev/ directory by a block device\&. It is the application\'s interface to the DRBD\-replicated block devices\&. These block devices get addressed by their minor numbers on the drbdsetup commandline\&.
.PP
A pair of replicated block devices may have different minor numbers on the two machines\&. They are associated by a common
\fIvolume\-number\fR\&. Volume numbers are local to each connection\&. Minor numbers are global on one node\&.
.SS "del\-resource"
.PP
Destroys a resource object\&. This is only possible if the resource has no volumes\&.
.SS "del\-minor"
.PP
Minors can only be destroyed if its disk is detached\&.
.SS "attach, disk\-options"
.\" drbdsetup: disk
.PP
Attach associates
\fIdevice\fR
with
\fIlower_device\fR
to store its data blocks on\&. The
\fB\-d\fR
(or
\fB\-\-disk\-size\fR) should only be used if you wish not to use as much as possible from the backing block devices\&. If you do not use
\fB\-d\fR, the
\fIdevice\fR
is only ready for use as soon as it was connected to its peer once\&. (See the
\fBnet\fR
command\&.)
.PP
With the disk\-options command it is possible to change the options of a minor while it is attached\&.
.PP
\fB\-\-disk\-size \fR\fB\fIsize\fR\fR
.RS 4
You can override DRBD\'s size determination method with this option\&. If you need to use the device before it was ever connected to its peer, use this option to pass the
\fIsize\fR
of the DRBD device to the driver\&. Default unit is sectors (1s = 512 bytes)\&.
.sp
If you use the
\fIsize\fR
parameter in drbd\&.conf, we strongly recommend to add an explicit unit postfix\&. drbdadm and drbdsetup used to have mismatching default units\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-on\-io\-error \fR\fB\fIerr_handler\fR\fR
.RS 4
If the driver of the
\fIlower_device\fR
reports an error to DRBD, DRBD will mark the disk as inconsistent, call a helper program, or detach the device from its backing storage and perform all further IO by requesting it from the peer\&. The valid
\fIerr_handlers\fR
are:
\fBpass_on\fR,
\fBcall\-local\-io\-error\fR
and
\fBdetach\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-fencing \fR\fB\fIfencing_policy\fR\fR
.RS 4
Under
\fBfencing\fR
we understand preventive measures to avoid situations where both nodes are primary and disconnected (AKA split brain)\&.
.sp
Valid fencing policies are:
.PP
\fBdont\-care\fR
.RS 4
This is the default policy\&. No fencing actions are done\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBresource\-only\fR
.RS 4
If a node becomes a disconnected primary, it tries to outdate the peer\'s disk\&. This is done by calling the fence\-peer handler\&. The handler is supposed to reach the other node over alternative communication paths and call \'drbdadm outdate res\' there\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBresource\-and\-stonith\fR
.RS 4
If a node becomes a disconnected primary, it freezes all its IO operations and calls its fence\-peer handler\&. The fence\-peer handler is supposed to reach the peer over alternative communication paths and call \'drbdadm outdate res\' there\&. In case it cannot reach the peer, it should stonith the peer\&. IO is resumed as soon as the situation is resolved\&. In case your handler fails, you can resume IO with the
\fBresume\-io\fR
command\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-disk\-barrier\fR, 
.br
\fB\-\-disk\-flushes\fR, 
.br
\fB\-\-disk\-drain\fR
.RS 4
DRBD has four implementations to express write\-after\-write dependencies to its backing storage device\&. DRBD will use the first method that is supported by the backing storage device and that is not disabled\&. By default the
\fIflush\fR
method is used\&.
.sp
Since drbd\-8\&.4\&.2
\fBdisk\-barrier\fR
is disabled by default because since linux\-2\&.6\&.36 (or 2\&.6\&.32 RHEL6) there is no reliable way to determine if queuing of IO\-barriers works\&.
\fIDangerous\fR
only enable if you are told so by one that knows for sure\&.
.sp
When selecting the method you should not only base your decision on the measurable performance\&. In case your backing storage device has a volatile write cache (plain disks, RAID of plain disks) you should use one of the first two\&. In case your backing storage device has battery\-backed write cache you may go with option 3\&. Option 4 (disable everything, use "none")
\fIis dangerous\fR
on most IO stacks, may result in write\-reordering, and if so, can theoretically be the reason for data corruption, or disturb the DRBD protocol, causing spurious disconnect/reconnect cycles\&.
\fIDo not use\fR
\fBno\-disk\-drain\fR\&.
.sp
Unfortunately device mapper (LVM) might not support barriers\&.
.sp
The letter after "wo:" in /proc/drbd indicates with method is currently in use for a device: b, f, d, n\&. The implementations:
.PP
barrier
.RS 4
The first requires that the driver of the backing storage device support barriers (called \'tagged command queuing\' in SCSI and \'native command queuing\' in SATA speak)\&. The use of this method can be enabled by setting the
\fBdisk\-barrier\fR
options to
\fByes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
flush
.RS 4
The second requires that the backing device support disk flushes (called \'force unit access\' in the drive vendors speak)\&. The use of this method can be disabled setting
\fBdisk\-flushes\fR
to
\fBno\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
drain
.RS 4
The third method is simply to let write requests drain before write requests of a new reordering domain are issued\&. That was the only implementation before 8\&.0\&.9\&.
.RE
.PP
none
.RS 4
The fourth method is to not express write\-after\-write dependencies to the backing store at all, by also specifying
\fB\-\-no\-disk\-drain\fR\&. This
\fIis dangerous\fR
on most IO stacks, may result in write\-reordering, and if so, can theoretically be the reason for data corruption, or disturb the DRBD protocol, causing spurious disconnect/reconnect cycles\&.
\fIDo not use\fR
\fB\-\-no\-disk\-drain\fR\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-md\-flushes\fR
.RS 4
Disables the use of disk flushes and barrier BIOs when accessing the meta data device\&. See the notes on
\fB\-\-disk\-flushes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-max\-bio\-bvecs\fR
.RS 4
In some special circumstances the device mapper stack manages to pass BIOs to DRBD that violate the constraints that are set forth by DRBD\'s merge_bvec() function and which have more than one bvec\&. A known example is: phys\-disk \-> DRBD \-> LVM \-> Xen \-> missaligned partition (63) \-> DomU FS\&. Then you might see "bio would need to, but cannot, be split:" in the Dom0\'s kernel log\&.
.sp
The best workaround is to proper align the partition within the VM (E\&.g\&. start it at sector 1024)\&. That costs 480 KiB of storage\&. Unfortunately the default of most Linux partitioning tools is to start the first partition at an odd number (63)\&. Therefore most distributions install helpers for virtual linux machines will end up with missaligned partitions\&. The second best workaround is to limit DRBD\'s max bvecs per BIO (i\&.e\&., the
\fBmax\-bio\-bvecs\fR
option) to 1, but that might cost performance\&.
.sp
The default value of
\fBmax\-bio\-bvecs\fR
is 0, which means that there is no user imposed limitation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-resync\-rate \fR\fB\fIrate\fR\fR
.RS 4
To ensure smooth operation of the application on top of DRBD, it is possible to limit the bandwidth that may be used by background synchronization\&. The default is 250 KiB/sec, the default unit is KiB/sec\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-resync\-after \fR\fB\fIminor\fR\fR
.RS 4
Start resync on this device only if the device with
\fIminor\fR
is already in connected state\&. Otherwise this device waits in SyncPause state\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-al\-extents \fR\fB\fIextents\fR\fR
.RS 4
DRBD automatically performs hot area detection\&. With this parameter you control how big the hot area (=active set) can get\&. Each extent marks 4M of the backing storage\&. In case a primary node leaves the cluster unexpectedly, the areas covered by the active set must be resynced upon rejoining of the failed node\&. The data structure is stored in the meta\-data area, therefore each change of the active set is a write operation to the meta\-data device\&. A higher number of extents gives longer resync times but less updates to the meta\-data\&. The default number of
\fIextents\fR
is 1237\&. (Minimum: 7, Maximum: 65534)
.sp
See also
\fBdrbd.conf\fR(5)
and
\fBdrbdmeta\fR(8)
for additional limitations and necessary preparation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-al\-updates \fR\fB{yes | no}\fR
.RS 4
DRBD\'s activity log transaction writing makes it possible, that after the crash of a primary node a partial (bit\-map based) resync is sufficient to bring the node back to up\-to\-date\&. Setting
\fBal\-updates\fR
to
\fBno\fR
might increase normal operation performance but causes DRBD to do a full resync when a crashed primary gets reconnected\&. The default value is
\fByes\fR\&.

.RS 4
The dynamic resync speed controller gets enabled with setting
\fIplan_time\fR
to a positive value\&. It aims to fill the buffers along the data path with either a constant amount of data
\fIfill_target\fR, or aims to have a constant delay time of
\fIdelay_target\fR
along the path\&. The controller has an upper bound of
\fImax_rate\fR\&.
.sp
By
\fIplan_time\fR
the agility of the controller is configured\&. Higher values yield for slower/lower responses of the controller to deviation from the target value\&. It should be at least 5 times RTT\&. For regular data paths a
\fIfill_target\fR
in the area of 4k to 100k is appropriate\&. For a setup that contains drbd\-proxy it is advisable to use
\fIdelay_target\fR
instead\&. Only when
\fIfill_target\fR
is set to 0 the controller will use
\fIdelay_target\fR\&. 5 times RTT is a reasonable starting value\&.
\fIMax_rate\fR
should be set to the bandwidth available between the DRBD\-hosts and the machines hosting DRBD\-proxy, or to the available disk\-bandwidth\&.
.sp
The default value of
\fIplan_time\fR
is 0, the default unit is 0\&.1 seconds\&.
\fIFill_target\fR
has 0 and sectors as default unit\&.
\fIDelay_target\fR
has 1 (100ms) and 0\&.1 as default unit\&.
\fIMax_rate\fR

\fB\-\-c\-min\-rate \fR\fB\fImin_rate\fR\fR

We track the disk IO rate caused by the resync, so we can detect non\-resync IO on the lower level device\&. If the lower level device seems to be busy, and the current resync rate is above
\fImin_rate\fR, we throttle the resync\&.
.sp
The default value of
\fImin_rate\fR
is 4M, the default unit is k\&. If you want to not throttle at all, set it to zero, if you want to throttle always, set it to one\&.

\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-disk\-timeout \fR\fB\fIdisk_timeout\fR\fR
.RS 4
If the lower\-level device on which a DRBD device stores its data does not finish an I/O request within the defined
\fBdisk\-timeout\fR, DRBD treats this as a failure\&. The lower\-level device is detached, and the device\'s disk state advances to Diskless\&. If DRBD is connected to one or more peers, the failed request is passed on to one of them\&.
.sp
This option is
\fIdangerous and may lead to kernel panic!\fR
.sp
"Aborting" requests, or force\-detaching the disk, is intended for completely blocked/hung local backing devices which do no longer complete requests at all, not even do error completions\&. In this situation, usually a hard\-reset and failover is the only way out\&.
.sp
By "aborting", basically faking a local error\-completion, we allow for a more graceful swichover by cleanly migrating services\&. Still the affected node has to be rebooted "soon"\&.
.sp
By completing these requests, we allow the upper layers to re\-use the associated data pages\&.
.sp
If later the local backing device "recovers", and now DMAs some data from disk into the original request pages, in the best case it will just put random data into unused pages; but typically it will corrupt meanwhile completely unrelated data, causing all sorts of damage\&.
.sp
Which means delayed successful completion, especially for READ requests, is a reason to panic()\&. We assume that a delayed *error* completion is OK, though we still will complain noisily about it\&.
.sp
The default value of
\fBdisk\-timeout\fR
is 0, which stands for an infinite timeout\&. Timeouts are specified in units of 0\&.1 seconds\&. This option is available since DRBD 8\&.3\&.12\&.

.PP
\fB\-\-discard\-zeroes\-if\-aligned \fR\fB{yes | no}\fR
.RS 4
Setting
\fBdiscard\-zeroes\-if\-aligned\fR
to
\fBno\fR
will cause DRBD to always fall\-back to zero\-out on the receiving side, and to not even announce discard capabilities on the Primary, if the respective backend announces discard_zeroes_data=false\&.
.sp
Setting
\fBdiscards\-zeroes\-if\-aligned\fR
to
\fByes\fR
will allow DRBD to use discards, and to announce discard_zeroes=true, even on backends that announce discard_zeroes_data=false\&.

command on one of your nodes\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-\-size\fR
option can be used to online shrink the usable size of a drbd device\&. It\'s the users responsibility to make sure that a file system on the device is not truncated by that operation\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-\-assume\-peer\-has\-space\fR
allows you to resize a device which is currently not connected to the peer\&. Use with care, since if you do not resize the peer\'s disk as well, further connect attempts of the two will fail\&.
.PP
When the
\fB\-\-assume\-clean\fR
option is given DRBD will skip the resync of the new storage\&. Only do this if you know that the new storage was initialized to the same content by other means\&.
.PP
The options
\fB\-\-al\-stripes\fR
and
\fB\-\-al\-stripe\-size\-kB\fR
may be used to change the layout of the activity log online\&. In case of internal meta data this may invovle shrinking the user visible size at the same time (unsing the
\fB\-\-size\fR) or increasing the avalable space on the backing devices\&.
.SS "check\-resize"
.\" drbdsetup: check-resize
.PP
To enable DRBD to detect offline resizing of backing devices this command may be used to record the current size of backing devices\&. The size is stored in files in /var/lib/drbd/ named drbd\-minor\-??\&.lkbd
.PP
This command is called by
\fBdrbdadm resize \fR\fB\fIres\fR\fR
after
\fBdrbdsetup \fR\fB\fIdevice\fR\fR\fB resize\fR
returned\&.
.SS "pause\-sync"
.\" drbdsetup: pause-sync
.PP
Temporarily suspend an ongoing resynchronization by setting the local pause flag\&. Resync only progresses if neither the local nor the remote pause flag is set\&. It might be desirable to postpone DRBD\'s resynchronization after eventual resynchronization of the backing storage\'s RAID setup\&.
.SS "resume\-sync"
.\" drbdsetup: resume-sync
.PP
Unset the local sync pause flag\&.
.SS "outdate"
.\" drbdsetup: outdate
.PP
Mark the data on the local backing storage as outdated\&. An outdated device refuses to become primary\&. This is used in conjunction with
\fBfencing\fR
and by the peer\'s
\fBfence\-peer\fR
handler\&.
.SS "show\-gi"
.\" drbdsetup: show-gi
.PP
Displays the device\'s data generation identifiers verbosely\&.
.SS "get\-gi"
.\" drbdsetup: get-gi
.PP
Displays the device\'s data generation identifiers\&.
.SS "show"
.\" drbdsetup: show
.PP
Shows all available configuration information of a resource, or of all resources\&. Available options:
.PP
\fB\-\-show\-defaults\fR
.RS 4
Show all configuration parameters, even the ones with default values\&. Normally, parameters with default values are not shown\&.
.RE
.SS "suspend\-io"
.\" drbdsetup: suspend-io
.PP
This command is of no apparent use and just provided for the sake of completeness\&.
.SS "resume\-io"
.\" drbdsetup: resume-io
.PP
If the fence\-peer handler fails to stonith the peer node, and your
\fBfencing\fR
policy is set to resource\-and\-stonith, you can unfreeze IO operations with this command\&.
.SS "status"
.\" drbdsetup: status
.PP
Show the status of a resource, or of all resources\&. The output consists of one paragraph for each configured resource\&. Each paragraph contains one line for each resource, followed by one line for each device, and one line for each connection\&. The device and connection lines are indented\&. The connection lines are followed by one line for each peer device; these lines are indented against the connection line\&.
.PP
Long lines are wrapped around at terminal width, and indented to indicate how the lines belongs together\&. Available options:
.PP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Include more information in the output even when it is likely redundant or irrelevant\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-statistics\fR
.RS 4
Include data transfer statistics in the output\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-color=\fR\fB{always | auto | never}\fR\fB \fR
.RS 4
Colorize the output\&. With
\fB\-\-color=auto\fR,
\fBdrbdsetup\fR
emits color codes only when standard output is connected to a terminal\&.
.RE
.PP
For example, the non\-verbose output for a resource with only one connection and only one volume could look like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
fs\-backoffice role:Primary
  disk:UpToDate
  peer role:Secondary
    replication:Established peer\-disk:UpToDate
	      
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.PP
With the
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
\fB\-\-statistics\fR
options, the same resource could be reported as:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
fs\-data role:Primary suspended:no
    write\-ordering:drain

.SS "events2"
.\" drbdsetup: events2
.PP
Show the current state of all configured DRBD objects, followed by all changes to the state\&.
.PP
The output format is meant to be human as well as machine readable\&. Each line starts with the event number, which is followed by an asterisk if the event continues in the next line\&. The second word in each line indicates the kind of event:
\fBexists\fR
for an existing object;
\fBcreate\fR,
\fBdestroy\fR, and
\fBchange\fR
if an object is created, destroyed, or changed; or
\fBcall\fR
or
\fBresponse\fR
if an event handler is called or it returns\&. The third word indicates the object the event applies to:
\fBresource\fR,
\fBdevice\fR,
\fBconnection\fR,
\fBpeer\-device\fR,
\fBhelper\fR, or a dash (\fB\-\fR) to indicate that the current state has been dumped completely\&.
.PP
The remaining words identify the object and describe the state that he object is in\&. Available options:
.PP
\fB\-\-now\fR
.RS 4
Terminate after reporting the current state\&. The default is to continuously listen and report state changes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-statistics\fR
.RS 4
Include statistics in the output\&.
.RE
.SS "events"
.\" drbdsetup: events
.PP
Deprecated\&. If possible, change to the events2 subcommand instead\&.
.PP
Displays every state change of DRBD and all calls to helper programs\&. This might be used to get notified of DRBD\'s state changes by piping the output to another program\&.
.PP
\fB\-\-all\-devices\fR
.RS 4
Display the events of all DRBD minors\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-unfiltered\fR
.RS 4
This is a debugging aid that displays the content of all received netlink messages\&.
.RE
.SS "new\-current\-uuid"
.\" drbdsetup: new-current-uuid
.PP
Generates a new current UUID and rotates all other UUID values\&. This has at least two use cases, namely to skip the initial sync, and to reduce network bandwidth when starting in a single node configuration and then later (re\-)integrating a remote site\&.
.PP
Available option:
.PP
\fB\-\-clear\-bitmap\fR
.RS 4
Clears the sync bitmap in addition to generating a new current UUID\&.
.RE
.PP
This can be used to skip the initial sync, if you want to start from scratch\&. This use\-case does only work on "Just Created" meta data\&. Necessary steps:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1

.PP
One obvious side\-effect is that the replica is full of old garbage (unless you made them identical using other means), so any online\-verify is expected to find any number of out\-of\-sync blocks\&.
.PP
\fIYou must not use this on pre\-existing data!\fR
Even though it may appear to work at first glance, once you switch to the other node, your data is toast, as it never got replicated\&. So
\fIdo not leave out the mkfs\fR
(or equivalent)\&.
.PP
This can also be used to shorten the initial resync of a cluster where the second node is added after the first node is gone into production, by means of disk shipping\&. This use\-case works on disconnected devices only, the device may be in primary or secondary role\&.
.PP
The necessary steps on the current active server are:
.sp
