 * Add unfence-peer handler
 * Fix "drbdadm adjust" for proxy configurations

8.9.5
--------
 * add support for new disk option 'rs-discard-granularity' (module v8.4.7)
 * add support for new disk option 'discard-zeroes-if-aligned' (module v8.4.7)

  * Allow multiple connection-mesh statements within one resource
  * Document peer-device-options on the drbd-9.0 man pages
  * increase the lower boundary for al-extents from 7 to 67; drbdadm clamps
    al-extents to 67 implicitly if you configures something lower than 67
  * Document the events2 command on the drbd-8.4 man page
  * Fix environment variables for handlers

8.9.3
--------
  * Support for the new new-peer, add-path, connect, del-path, disconnect
    and del-peer commands of drbd-9.0.0; drbdadm support for the new
    commands

    file for the common section of a resource can be specified
  * Rewrite the parser for configure options; reuse the data structures
    describing drbdsetup options
  * No longer try to set peer-device-options with the connect or attach
    commands; Only do it with the up and attach commands

  * Allow recursive includes; drbdadm includes each config file only once
  * Fix parsing cut-off proxy sections
  * When converting 8.4 to 9.0 meta-data produce meta-data the drbd9
    kernel driver will accept

  * Do not re-register at usage.drbd.org when the module is not loaded
    when drbdadm is invoked

8.9.2

  * drbd 9: make transport selectable
  * fix aggregating drbdsetup / drbdmeta exit statii
  * some documentation fixes (content and build)
  * added direct-connect command
  * incompatible drbd-9 metadata format change. use: node_id as index for
    peer_md instead of the bitmap_index
  * drbdadm/meta/usage_cnt: ensure output is visible
