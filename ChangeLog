9.0.0
--------
 * drbd udev: fix inconsistent inheritance of implicit volumes
   To keep previous udev /dev/drbd/by-resource/... behavior,
   you may need to set or unset/comment "global { udev-always-use-vnr; }",
   see the shipped example global_common.conf
 * Fix regressions of the out-of-the-box DRBD 8.4 experience
   with our pacemaker DRBD Resource Agent and shipped example config files

8.9.10
--------
 * new drbdmon tool, which provides a compact overview about resources.
   In contrast to drbdsetup status it provides live monitoring.
   This requires a C++11 compiler.
 * drbdadm parser got substantially faster for thousands of resources
 * send SIGKILL to childs if parent (drbdadm) dies.

8.9.9
--------
 * fix --skip-disk/--skip-net when used with more than one resource
 * events2 of v8.4: Fake peer-node-ids to make it in-line with  v9
 * fix drbdadm crashes in set-gi and new-current-uuid
 * new peer_device option (--bitmap=no) to indicate that for this peer
   no bitmap slot should be allocated in the meta-data; This is used
   by all peers of a (configured) diskless node; saves bitmap-slots,
   thus allows you to use smaller max-peers numbers, thus saves memory
   and CPU resources
 * removed sh-status from v9

8.9.8
--------
 * fix a lot of regressions from allowing to pass command options
   on the drbdadm adjust commandline. (filtering of backend options)
 * wait-for-* return success if there are no peers
 * naturally align 64 bit attributes in gennetlink packets
 * improve systemd unit-file to wait for network-online.target
 * return success for a resize to the same size even if a resync
   does not allow as resize at this point in time
 * improve sh-nop with --config-to-test with new --config-to-exclude
   and correct exit code
 * implemented --json for drbdsetup status

8.9.7
--------
 * allow to pass peer device options on the drbdadm command-line
 * fix drbdadm net-options by not passing the transport
   (the transport of a connection can not be changed while the connection is
    online)
 * options passed on the drbdadm command-line now overrule settings from
   the configuration file when calling drbdsetup
 * new resource option max-io-depth (v9 only)
 * allow partial adjust by --skip-disk and/or --skip-net
 * support for a new meta-data flag that helps resize operations
 * workaround for sysfs entries and del_gendisk and add_disk;
   in case drbdsetup sees those sysfs entries it exits immediately,
   that prevents half initialized drbd devices that can not be removed
 * drbdadm resize waits until new new size is user visible
 * support for the reload operation in the OCF resource agent
 * drbdadm's parser now reports too long strings with a meaningful
   error message
 * increased the size of the uniqueness hash-table, to support up to
   to 1000 resources

8.9.6
--------
 * Call "drbdsetup resize" only as often as necessary on "drbdadm resize"
 * Disconnect connection first on single path deletion from connection
 * Add unfence-peer handler
 * Fix "drbdadm adjust" for proxy configurations

8.9.5
--------
 * add support for new disk option 'rs-discard-granularity' (module v8.4.7)
 * add support for new disk option 'discard-zeroes-if-aligned' (module v8.4.7)
 * add support for v9 "path" commands
 * doc improvements/corrections
 * improvements to drbd ocf resource agent
   and pacemaker "constraint based fencing" (crm-fence-peer.sh)
 * drbd-overview improvements

8.9.4
--------
  * Add an autoconf switch for building without man pages
  * Fix compatibility with the musl C library
  * Introduce the concept of paths within a connection to the config file;
    add support for paths to drbdadm adjust
  * Allow multiple connection-mesh statements within one resource
  * Document peer-device-options on the drbd-9.0 man pages
  * increase the lower boundary for al-extents from 7 to 67; drbdadm clamps
    al-extents to 67 implicitly if you configures something lower than 67
  * Document the events2 command on the drbd-8.4 man page
  * Fix environment variables for handlers

8.9.3
--------
  * Support for the new new-peer, add-path, connect, del-path, disconnect
    and del-peer commands of drbd-9.0.0; drbdadm support for the new
    commands
  * New configuration file directive template-file; with that a dedicated
    file for the common section of a resource can be specified
  * Rewrite the parser for configure options; reuse the data structures
    describing drbdsetup options
  * No longer try to set peer-device-options with the connect or attach
    commands; Only do it with the up and attach commands
  * Fixed issues with stderr messages might go into arbitrary FDs
  * Allow recursive includes; drbdadm includes each config file only once
  * Fix parsing cut-off proxy sections
  * When converting 8.4 to 9.0 meta-data produce meta-data the drbd9
    kernel driver will accept
  * Obey max-peers for all volumes when creating meta-data
  * Do not re-register at usage.drbd.org when the module is not loaded
    when drbdadm is invoked

  * drbd 9: make transport selectable
  * fix aggregating drbdsetup / drbdmeta exit statii
  * some documentation fixes (content and build)
  * added direct-connect command
  * incompatible drbd-9 metadata format change. use: node_id as index for
    peer_md instead of the bitmap_index
  * drbdadm/meta/usage_cnt: ensure output is visible
  * drbdsetup: fix arguments for all commands expecting a peer_device
  * exit codes: redefine E_USAGE to 1 (not 3)

  * update xen block-drbd helper: allow for type "phy"
  * update udev rules and move from /etc/ to /lib/
  * fix various regressions/fallout from the kernel/userland package split,
    re-add scripts drbddisk and drbdupper,
    re-add "become-on-primary" feature to init script
