Description: RAID 1 over tcp/ip for Linux utilities
 Drbd is a block device which is designed to build high availability
 clusters by providing a virtual shared device which keeps disks in
 nodes synchronised using TCP/IP. This simulates RAID 1 but avoiding
 the use of uncommon hardware (shared SCSI buses or Fibre Channel).
 It is currently limited to fail-over HA clusters.
 .
 This package contains the programs that will control the drbd kernel
 module provided in the Linux kernel.
